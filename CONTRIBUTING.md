Issue Tracker
-------------

We use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sony/easyhttpcpp/issues) hosted in 
[EasyHttp](https://github.com/sony/easyhttpcpp) repository.

If you encounter any bugs, or come up with any feature requests, please first search if there is an already existing 
issue. If you can not find any, please feel free to post a new issue.

Pull Request
------------

We appreciate contributors in the community, that are willing to improve EasyHttp. When submitting code, 
please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

We follow the development style used in many GitHub repositories.

1. Search existing issues and/or pull requests in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sony/easyhttpcpp).

2. If it doesn't exist, post an issue for the feature proposal.

3. Fork the repository, and develop your feature in the forked repo.

4. Create a pull request of your development branch to EasyHttp's `master` branch.
   Our maintainers will then review your changes.

5. Once your change is finalized, the maintainer will merge your change.
